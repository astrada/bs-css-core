## [10.0.0] - 2019-09-04

Major release because of the breaking change in shadows definition.

### Breaking change

- Css.rule is now an abstract type [#153](https://github.com/SentiaAnalytics/bs-css/issues/153)
- Update shadow definition [#148](https://github.com/SentiaAnalytics/bs-css/issues/148)

boxShadow has been changed to be a rule to allow for `none`, `important` and all other rule related functions.

It means that the shadow properties must be updated to the following patterns:
```reason
// before:
boxShadow(~x=px(1), ~y=px(2));
boxShadows([boxShadow(yellow), boxShadow(red)]);
textShadow(~y=px(3), ~blur=px(2), black);
textShadows([textShadow(~y=px(3), ~blur=px(2), black), textShadow(~x=px(3), green)]);

// after:
boxShadow(Shadow.box(~x=px(1), ~y=px(2)));
boxShadows([Shadow.box(yellow), Shadow.box(red)]);
textShadow(Shadow.text(~y=px(3), ~blur=px(2), black));
textShadows([Shadow.text(~y=px(3), ~blur=px(2), black), Shadow.text(~x=px(3), green)]);
```

- Add support for `grid-template-areas` and `grid-area` by [@drew887](https://github.com/drew887) - [#156](https://github.com/SentiaAnalytics/bs-css/issues/156)

- :house: [#91](https://github.com/SentiaAnalytics/bs-css/issues/91) - Swapped glamor runtime to emotion runtime

#### Breaking changes

This version of bs-css is using a new runtime library that replaces glamor.
 
This decision is driven by the following points:

- the author of glamor is no more maintaining its project, the last commit happened more than one year ago,
- emotion is the recommended alternative because it mostly matches glamor's API
- better grid support : glamor uses a lot of the old -ms-grid and -webkit-grid prefixes (with IE11 support)
- Merging styles with sub selectors work as expected and fix a bug bs-css had

Given that it is a major version, we also changed some functions in the API, especially regarding merging.

#### Migration

- `fontWeight` number must now use the `num` constructor: you must change `fontWeight(300)` to `fontWeight(num(300))`.
The benefit is that you can transform your absolute numbers to font names, see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-weight#Common_weight_name_mapping. 
- `merge` was really a `concat` function and could lead to problems as seen in #86. This is why it has been changed to use 
the internal library (emotion) and its signature is now : `list(string) => string`. If you want to keep the same functionality
than before, you can use `List.concat` instead or `@` operator.
- if you are mixin reason/js, you need to change your dependency and replace `glamor` with `emotion`
- `flexGrow` accepts a float instead of an int, add a `.` to your int value (for ex, convert `1` to `1.`)
